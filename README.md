📊 Introducing Asthma Prediction Notebook 🌬️

Check out this notebook on Asthma Prediction using Machine Learning! 🤖

In the ever-evolving landscape of healthcare, AI and machine learning are making significant contributions. I'm excited thrilled to share this project focusing on the application of AI in medical care, specifically in improving Asthma Care. Here's a glimpse :

Application of AI in Medical Care:

🔍 Improving Asthma Care: The primary goal was to enhance asthma care by accurately predicting the severity of this condition.

💡 Machine Learning Tech : Harnessed the power of machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and XGBoost, to create predictive models.

📈 Data-Driven Insights: With access to anonymized health records and patient data, invaluable insights into the factors influencing asthma severity we noticed .

🌟 Empowering Early Diagnosis: Our predictive models have the potential to empower healthcare professionals with valuable tools for early diagnosis and personalized treatment planning.

Conclusion:
In our quest to improve Asthma Care, we employed the following models:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
XGBoost

Our models achieved an accuracy score of 0.75, marking a significant step forward in enhancing patient care. We are excited about the potential impact of our work and remain committed to furthering the application of AI in healthcare.
